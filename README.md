## Project Overview
This dataset focuses on various ships and the specific reasons they failed to meet their scheduled deadlines.
It includes detailed information such as ship names, STS providers, etc.

## Data Source
This dataset was provided by my instructor specifically for my project. It serves as the foundation for my analysis and research work.
This allows me to apply the concepts and skills I've learned during my course.

## Tools
Power Query and Power Bi.

## Data cleaning
The dataset is clean and free of errors.

## Data Analysis
1. How many days did all the STS providers spend in Lomé?
2. How many STS providers are involved in ship-to-ship transfers in Lomé?
3. What is the total number of ships engaged in ship-to-ship transfers in Lomé?
4. What is the total number of crew members involved in ship-to-ship transfers in Lomé?
5. How many different nationalities were represented among the crew members in Lomé during ship-to-ship transfers?
6. What were the various types of cargo being transported during ship-to-ship transfers in Lomé?

## Finding and Result
1. (6 ships = 18 days), (290 ships = 21 days), (1 ship= 43 days), (153 ships = 47 days), (255 ships = 57 days), (182 ships = 62 days), (98 ships = 69 days)
2. There were 5 STS providers involved: Grove, ROTC, HAIM, Cadogan, and Berner.
3. The total number of ships engaged in STS transfers is 985.
4. The total number of crew members on the 985 ships is 19,000.
5. The various nationalities represented among the 985 ships are English, French, Georgian, Indian, Russian, and Spanish.
6. The different cargos being transported during STS operations in Lomé include crude oil, kerosene, jet fuel, diesel, cooking oil, and gasoline.

Also;
1. In my research on delays affecting ships' arrivals, I've identified key issues at the Port of Lomé, a crucial maritime hub. The port, primarily designed for container traffic, has
two smaller bulk terminals with fewer berths, leading to frequent congestion for bulk carriers. The issue stems from the simultaneous berthing needs of numerous bulk carriers.
2. This dataset covers ships carrying 5,000 to 150,000 tons of cargo, often forced to wait for available berths to load or unload, causing delays. Crude oil, the heaviest and densest
petroleum product is a major cargo transported in quantities up to 150,000 tons.
3. Also, these could be other reasons as to why the ships were late to their destination and they include;
a. Weather Conditions
b. Mechanical Issues
c. Incorrect or Missing Documentation
d. Late Container Returns
e. Global Emergencies
f. Pirates
   
finally, These factors, ranging from external disruptions to operational challenges, can collectively contribute to delays in a ship's arrival at its destination, underscoring the
complexities and various issues that can affect maritime logistics and shipping operations.

## Recommendation
1. STS providers must notify the relevant government department at least 48 hours in advance, providing operation details, vessels involved, type and quantity of oil,
location, expected start time, and duration. They must also confirm having an approved STS operations plan by the region.
2. Ships should maintain a strict schedule and adhere to it as closely as possible to avoid unnecessary delays.
3. Ensure proper documentation is prepared accurately and in advance. Incorrect or missing documentation can lead to delays in customs clearance and port operations.
4. Maintain good communication with port authorities, agents, and the shipping company. Provide timely updates on the ship's status and estimated time of arrival.
If delays are anticipated, work with stakeholders to minimize the impact. **This way, the client doesn't get disappointed**.
